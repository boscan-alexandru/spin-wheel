# Spin Wheel

This is a very simple spin the wheel game made in basing HTML and css with some javascript, it is just a project made for fun. Please feel free to fork this repository if you want to make changes to it. After you are done please make a pull request and i'll review your changes.

## Installation steps

There is nothing fancy about this project and is very easy to install it locally you your machine.
Just clone this repo and open the index.html file. I usually use the Live Server extension in VS Code but feel free to use whatever Code editor or server you prefer.
